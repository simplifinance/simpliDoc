    paragraph1: (
      <p>
        A collection of communities that have come together to support one
        another by contributing certain amount, total of which is given to the
        each member for use rotationally usually for a short period of time.
        Such period cannot be greater than 255 days. The beneficiary makes use
        of the fund for the set period of time and return it to the pool. This
        is system known mostly with the Africans and we have redefined it to be
        accessible to anyone anywhere around the world. Seen a method of raising
        funds among the Africans where two or more people come together to
        support one another in raising fund for a particular endeavor or project
        usually in a small or medium way. Often, it is in rotational order
        without charging any form of interest. There are couple of setbacks
        associated with this method such as lack of trust, dubious action where
        one person refuses to pay back and much more. Using blockchain
        potentials and strategies, we provide solutions while digitalizing this
        culture.

    paragraph2: (
      <p>
        With Digesu, users have more than one option and designs. Let&apos;s
        take a scenario where Bob, Alice and Kate decide to fund one another
        using Digesu with each depositing 3BNB. Firstly the trust aspect is
        removed when you make the choice to subscribe to Digesu. Bob, decide to
        launch a band on Digesu in a strict mode which only Alice and Kate can
        join thereafter. At this point, we have a quorum of 3 and total BNB in
        the band account will be 9.
      </p>
    ),
    paragraph3: (
      <p>
        Based on the algorithm we used, the first to come is the first to be
        served. Bob will then proceed to get financed with an amount of 9BNB. He
        is required to have an e equivalent amount of QFTs in his wallet before
        the fund can be released to him. If Bob had set up the band with a
        multiplier of say 1.5 (that is, collateral index) then Bob will have QFT
        amount of 9BNB 1.5 in his wallet. This pattern continues until a cycle
        is completed. It is largely user-controlled and simply a collection of
        many bands. This is only a part of the plan. Digesu has different
        categories.

    paragraph4: (
      <p>
        On the second category, starting from Nigeria with over 200Million
        population, our target is a fraction of the to all population who make
        at least a penny daily but keep them idle either in the bank or
        somewhere with the man who comes to take them everyday without yielding
        interest..
